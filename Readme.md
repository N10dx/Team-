# Data Analysis Project: Company Call Analysis

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, conducted by:
- Mohammed Alharbi
- Said Qahs
- Sadeem Fihra

We have thoroughly analyzed call data within the company using Python's data analysis libraries. The project addressed a challenge faced by the company's communication department, which struggled to gain meaningful insights from the call records. Our analysis aimed to visualize call patterns, identify trends, and optimize communication strategies.

## Problem Statement

The communication department within the company was struggling to understand call patterns due to complex and unclear call data. The existing call records lacked insights, making it difficult to optimize communication strategies. The communication department sought a data analysis solution to assist them in:

- Visualizing call volume trends over time.
- Identifying peak call hours and days.
- Recognizing call durations and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contained information about calls within the company. It included fields like call timestamp, caller name, receiver name, call duration, and the departments.

## Tools and Libraries Used

We employed the following tools and libraries for this analysis:

- using python in jupyter platform
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- seaborn
- datetime

## Approach

1. **Import Required Libraries**: We imported necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Load and Preprocess Call Data**: The call dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame. We converted the call timestamps to datetime format and extracted relevant date and time components. Unnecessary columns were removed from the dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Calls**: We calculated basic statistics of the call data. A line plot was created to visualize the daily call volume trends over time, helping us identify general call activity trends.

4. **Insights and Visualizations**: Peak call hours were identified by determining the most common call times. Calls were segmented based on departments to understand call volume distribution.

5. **Conclusion**: Our analysis provided insights into call volume trends, peak hours, and department-specific patterns. We highlighted how optimizing communication strategies based on these insights could enhance the communication department's efficiency.
